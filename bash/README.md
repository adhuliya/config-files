Bash Settings
============

Just add the one line at the end of the .bashrc file

FOR ROOT:
source /home/codeman/mydata/configs-git/bash/bashrc-root.sh

FOR REGULAR USER:
source /home/codeman/mydata/configs-git/bash/bashrc-user.sh


bashrc-common.sh is the common file shared with the root and the user.
