mydata = One folder with all my data
=============================

Each top level folder in this directory is as follows:

bin-git   = (scripts) Scripts for backup and to maintain mydata and other things
configs-git   = (config) Config files for common sofwares I use
work   = (documents) Things I am currently working on
work-archive  = (documents-archive) Things I worked in the past
multimedia  = (multi-media) Photos-Videos-Music, pics/vids of events
packages  = (packages) Some important softwares specially drivers 
packages-live = (packages) Softwares currently in use from this location
tmp   = (tmp) A temporary folder like a scratchpad for junk (cleaned up regularly)

Over and above moving old things into the 'da' folder, in each folder if there are things that won't be touched for quite some time, then they are coverted into a *.tar.gz archive in place, reducing the clutter and the number of files easing the transfer of data to the backups.

The '-git' suffix denotes that the folder contents are maintained in a remote git repository as well.
