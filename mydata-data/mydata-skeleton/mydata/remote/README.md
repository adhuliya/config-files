`remote` or `master` folder
=================================

This folder contains long term data. It is named `master` on the system which contains ALL the data in its latest and greatest version. All other systems contain `remote` folder which have *copied* content from the `master` folder. At all times the `remote` should contain no file/folder which is not present in `master`.
